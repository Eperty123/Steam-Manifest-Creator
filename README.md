# Steam-Manifest-Creator
Stop Steam from re-downloading your games!

# Description
If you ever had experienced Steam re-downloading your games even though you've copied all the files required to right folder then you'd know that it's
a pain to download them all over again. But guess what, SMC (Steam Manifest Creator) will fix the issue by creating the necessary manifest file for the appropriate games.

SMC will not patch, hack or download additional files that may harm your Steam account or computer. All it does is creating the manifest file for the games you already have.
This is very useful if you have a backup copy of your games from a harddrive that you want to copy back to your Steam library.

<b>Note:</b> <i>You must have the games in your Steam account otherwise it won't work.</i>
# Coding
SMC is coded in VB.net due to my laziness of not bothering creating it in C#. I may change it in the future, consider it a subject-to-change for now.

# Requirements
* Visual C++ Runtime 2013 (both x86 and x64)
* Windows Vista*, 7, 8, 8.1 or 10.
* Dot net 4.5.
